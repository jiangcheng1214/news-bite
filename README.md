# News bite

*Our news consumer, processor, and renderer is a highly scalable system that delivers high-quality news without compromising neutrality.*

Data Consuming

* The system monitors multiple information sources, including Bloomberg and Twitter, to ensure that it gathers the latest and most comprehensive news.

Data Processing

* Our system uses advanced artificial intelligence techniques to deduplicate and summarize the collected raw data. This ensures that the news provided is both concise and informative.

Data Rendering

* Structured summarizations are rendered in flexible formats, such as web-pages, mini-applications, and emails, among others, making the news easily accessible to users.

## virtual env

Using `conda` without the full Anaconda distribution. We can use Miniconda, which is a smaller, more lightweight alternative to Anaconda that still provides the powerful package management features of `conda`.

1. Download the Miniconda installer for macOS from the official website:

   [Miniconda macOS installer](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

2. Install Miniconda by following the installation instructions for macOS:

   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the Miniconda installer is downloaded.
   - Run the installer with the following command:
   
     ```bash
     bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
     ```

   - Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

3. Close and reopen your terminal to apply the changes, or run:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

   depending on your shell.

4. Create a new `conda` environment:

   ```bash
   conda create --name myenv python=3.11
   ```

5. Activate the new `conda` environment:

   ```bash
   conda activate myenv
   ```

6. Now, try installing `pysocks` again:

   ```bash
   pip install pysocks
   ```

This should resolve the issue, and you should be able to install and use `pysocks` within the new Miniconda environment. Please let me know if you still encounter any issues.
